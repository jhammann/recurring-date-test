# About

I wanted to learn more about recurring dates so I created a small project with a simple UI ([Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/)).
I use the [ice_cube](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube) Rubygem for handling repeated events and I use the [recurring_select](https://github.com/GetJobber/recurring_select) gem for it's helpers and selectors.
